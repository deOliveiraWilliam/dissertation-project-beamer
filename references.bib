@article{Ancey2007,
  abstract        = {The objective of this review is to examine how the concept of plasticity is used in geophysical fluid dynamics. Rapid mass movements such as snow avalanches or debris flows involve slurries of solid particles (ice, boulder, clay, etc.) within an interstitial fluid (air, water). The bulk behavior of these materials has often been modeled as plastic materials, i.e., a plastic material yields and starts to flow once its stress state has significantly departed from equilibrium. Two plastic theories are of common use in fluid dynamics: Coulomb plasticity and viscoplasticity. These theories have little in common, since ideal Coulomb materials are two-phase materials for which pore pressure and friction play the key role in the bulk dynamics, whereas viscoplastic materials (e.g., Bingham fluids) typically behave as single-phase fluids on the macroscopic scale and exhibit a viscous behavior after yielding. Determining the rheological behavior of geophysical materials remains difficult because they encompass coarse, irregular particles over a very wide range of size. Consequently, the true nature of plastic behavior for geophysical flows is still vigorously debated. In this review, we first set out the continuum-mechanics principles used for describing plastic behavior. The notion of yield surface rather than yield stress is emphasized in order to better understand how tensorial constitutive equations can be derived from experimental data. The notion of single-phase or two-phase behaviors on the macroscopic scale is then examined using a microstructural analysis on idealized suspensions of spheres within a Newtonian fluid; for these suspensions, the single-phase approximation is valid only at very high or low Stokes numbers. Within this framework, the bulk stress tensor can also be constructed, which makes it possible to give a physical interpretation to yield stress. Most of the time, depending on the bulk properties (especially, particle size) and flow features, bulk behavior is either Coulomb-like or viscoplastic in simple-shear experiments. The consequences of the rheological properties on the flow features are also examined. Some remarkable properties of the governing equations describing thin layers flowing down inclined surfaces are discussed. Finally, the question of parameter fitting is tackled: since rheological properties cannot be measured directly in most cases, they must be evaluated from field data. As an example, we show that the Coulomb model successfully captures the main traits of avalanche motion, but statistical analysis demonstrates that the probability distribution of the friction coefficient is not universal. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The critical diameter ratio is correlated in terms of a dimensionless yield-gravity group Y = $\tau$y/gd($\rho${variant}s - $\rho${variant}); it appears to be related to the dimensions of the sheared fluid envelope surrounding the sphere.

A series of aqueous solutions of different grades of Carbopol resin have been used to encompass wide ranges of rheological model parameters. In particular, the size and shape of the sheared cavity surrounding a moving sphere and the drag behaviour have been investigated in this study. A laser-speckle tracer method was used to obtain information on the structure of the flow field about a sphere which, in turn, shows the size and shape of the underformed regions in the flow domain. The measured terminal velocity data together with the physical properties and dimensions have been used to deduce the values of drag coefficient as a function of the pertinent dimensionless groups. The paper is concluded by presenting extensive comparisons, of both sheared cavity characteristics and drag behaviour, between the present results and the literature correlations and/or data. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The study deals with elastic fluids that exhibit shear-thinning behaviour, and focuses on the stagnation flow along the centerline behind the sphere. The experimental Weissenberg number is varied up to approximately 3.5. The speed of the sphere relative to the cylinder is fixed and the Weissenberg number is changed by adjusting the fluid properties. In this way a wide range of behaviour is produced, varying from the upstream shift of streamlines and velocity overshoot ('negative wake') seen in some previous experimental investigations to the downstream shift of streamlines characteristic of elastic fluids having shear-constant viscosity. The simulations indicate that the net response is strongly influenced by the elongational properties of the fluid, and this is used to rationalise the observed behaviour. In particular, it is shown that the Weissenberg number alone is not a sufficient basis for characterisation of the flow. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

  abstract        = {The problem of irrotational inviscid incompressible free-surface flow is examined in the limit of small Froude number. Since this is a singular perturbation, singularities in the flow field (or its analytic continuation) such as stagnation points, or corners in submerged objects or on rough beds, lead to a divergent asymptotic expansion, with associated Stokes lines. Recent techniques in exponential asymptotics are employed to observe the switching on of exponentially small gravity waves across these Stokes lines. As a concrete example, the flow over astep is considered. It is found that there are three possible parameter regimes, depending on whether the dimensionless step height is small, of the same order, or large compared to the square of the Froude number. Asymptotic results are derived in each case, and compared with numerical simulations of the full nonlinear problem. The agreement is remarkably good, even at relatively large Froude number. This is in contrast to the alternative analytical theory of small step height, which is accurate only for very small steps. {\textcopyright} 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract        = {Oxy-fuel combustion has generated significant interest since it was proposed as a carbon capture technology for newly built and retrofitted coal-fired power plants. Research, development and demonstration of oxy-fuel combustion technologies has been advancing in recent years; however, there are still fundamental issues and technological challenges that must be addressed before this technology can reach its full potential, especially in the areas of combustion in oxygen-carbon dioxide environments and potentially at elevated pressures. This paper presents a technical review of oxy-coal combustion covering the most recent experimental and simulation studies, and numerical models for sub-processes are also used to examine the differences between combustion in an oxidizing stream diluted by nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The evolution of this technology from its original inception for high temperature processes to its current form for carbon capture is introduced, followed by a discussion of various oxy-fuel systems proposed for carbon capture. Of all these oxy-fuel systems, recent research has primarily focused on atmospheric air-like oxy-fuel combustion in a CO 2-rich environment. Distinct heat and mass transfer, as well as reaction kinetics, have been reported in this environment because of the difference between the physical and chemical properties of CO 2 and N 2, which in turn changes the flame characteristics. By tracing the physical and chemical processes that coal particles experience during combustion, the characteristics of oxy-fuel combustion are reviewed in the context of heat and mass transfer, fuel delivery and injection, coal particle heating and moisture evaporation, devolatilization and ignition, char oxidation and gasification, as well as pollutants formation. Operation under elevated pressures has also been proposed for oxy-coal combustion systems in order to improve the overall energy efficiency. The potential impact of elevated pressures on oxy-fuel combustion is discussed when applicable. Narrower flammable regimes and lower laminar burning velocity under oxy-fuel combustion conditions may lead to new stability challenges in operating oxy-coal burners. Recent research on stabilization of oxy-fuel combustion is reviewed, and some guiding principles for retrofit are summarized. Distinct characteristics in oxy-coal combustion necessitate modifications of CFD sub-models because the approximations and assumptions for air-fuel combustion may no longer be valid. Advances in sub-models for turbulent flow, heat transfer and reactions in oxy-coal combustion simulations, and the results obtained using CFD are reviewed. Based on the review, research needs in this combustion technology are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {Flows of natural mud-water mixtures are of great interest for industrial and civil engineering. But there is still no general agreement about the methods for determining the main rheological characteristics of these systems. We propose here an accurate rheological study of some natural mud-water mixtures. We first discuss the possible effects of changing various parameters such as temperature, pH, electrolyte concentration, solid concentration, clay type. The behavior of these muds appears to be very sensitive to most of these parameters and to be hardly predictable from a knowledge of their components. Then, we show that a Herschel-Bulkley model fits very well steady flow experimental data for a very large range of shear rates. We also suggest physical explanations of this model in agreement with our observations of behavior changes when some parameters change. The yield stress value of this model provides a good estimation of real yield stress which is a key parameter for mixture behavior. These considerations are very useful to characterize, predict, and compare various mud flows. {\textcopyright} 1994 Steinkopff-Verlag.},

@article{Divoux2011,
  abstract        = {We report a large amount of experimental data on the stress overshoot phenomenon which takes place during start-up shear flows in a simple yield stress fluid, namely a carbopol microgel. A combination of classical rheological measurements and ultrasonic velocimetry makes it possible to get physical insights on the transient dynamics of both the stress $\sigma$(t) and the velocity field across the gap of a rough cylindrical Couette cell during the start-up of shear under an applied shear rate . (i) At small strains ($\gamma$ < 1), $\sigma$(t) increases linearly and the microgel undergoes homogeneous deformation. (ii) At a time tm, the stress reaches a maximum value $\sigma$m which corresponds to the failure of the microgel and to the nucleation of a thin lubrication layer at the moving wall. (iii) The microgel then experiences a strong elastic recoil and enters a regime of total wall slip while the stress slowly decreases. (iv) Total wall slip gives way to a transient shear-banding phenomenon, which occurs on timescales much longer than that of the stress overshoot and has been described elsewhere [Divoux et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2010, 104, 208301]. This whole sequence is very robust to concentration changes in the explored range (0.5 ≤ C ≤ 3%w/w). We further demonstrate that the maximum stress $\sigma$m and the corresponding strain $\gamma$m = tm both depend on the applied shear rate  and on the waiting time tw between preshear and shear start-up: they remain roughly constant as long as  is smaller than some critical shear rate w - 1/tw and they increase as weak power laws of  for  > w. Finally, by changing the boundary conditions from rough to smooth, we show that there exists a critical shear rate s fixed by the wall surface roughness below which slip at both walls allows for faster stress relaxation and for stress fluctuations strongly reminiscent of stick-slip. Interestingly, the value of s is observed to coincide with the shear rate below which the flow curve displays a kink attributed to wall slip.},

@article{Gariano2016,
  abstract        = {Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a warming climate. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors},

  abstract        = {This article presents a wind plant control strategy that optimizes the yaw settings of wind turbines for improved energy production of the whole wind plant by taking into account wake effects. The optimization controller is based on a novel internal parametric model for wake effects called the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady-state (FLORIS) model. The FLORIS model predicts the steady-state wake locations and the effective flow velocities at each turbine, and the resulting turbine electrical energy production levels, as a function of the axial induction and the yaw angle of the different rotors. The FLORIS model has a limited number of parameters that are estimated based on turbine electrical power production data. In high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of a small wind plant, we demonstrate that the optimization control based on the FLORIS model increases the energy production of the wind plant, with a reduction of loads on the turbines as an additional effect.

It is shown that there are two competing viscoelastic forces at work in this flow. The relaxation downstream of shear stresses generated near the side of the sphere drives a flow directed away from the sphere, giving rise to a negative wake. This force is opposed by the extensional stresses generated in the extensional flow at the rear of the sphere, which drives a flow towards the sphere producing an extended wake. The parameter controlling the balance between these forces is the extensibility of the polymer, which limits the extensional viscosity, with high extensibility producing an extended wake and smaller values giving negative wakes.},

  abstract        = {The spreading and sediment deposit of a two-dimensional, unsteady, laminar mud flow from a constant-volume source on a relatively steep slope is studied theoretically and experimentally. The mud under consideration has the rheological properties of a Herschel–Bulkley fluid. The flow is of low-Reynolds-number type and has a well-formed wave front moving a substantial distance downslope. Due to the nonlinear rheological characteristics, a set of nonlinear partial differential equations is needed for this transient problem. Depth-integrated continuity and momentum equations are derived by applying von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n's momentum integral method. A matched-asymptotic perturbation method is implemented analytically to get asymptotic solutions for both the outer region away from, and the inner region near, the wave front. The outer solution gives accurate results for spreading characteristics, while the inner solution, which is shown to agree well with experimental results of Liu & Mei (1989) for a Bingham fluid, predicts fairly well the free-surface profile near the wave front. A composite solution uniformly valid over the whole spreading length is then achieved through a matching of the inner and outer solutions in an overlapping region. The range of accuracy of the solution and the size of the inner and overlapping regions are quantified by physical scaling analyses. Rheological and dynamic measurements are obtained through laboratory experiments. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results, showing reasonable agreement. The impact of shear thinning on the runout characteristics, free-surface profiles and final deposit of the mud flow is examined. A mud flow with shear thinning spreads beyond the runout distance estimated by a Bingham model, and has a long and thin deposit.},

@article{Hurlimann2019,
  abstract        = {Debris flows represent one of the most dangerous types of mass movements, because of their high velocities, large impact forces and long runout distances. This review describes the available debris-flow monitoring techniques and proposes recommendations to inform the design of future monitoring and warning/alarm systems. The selection and application of these techniques is highly dependent on site and hazard characterization, which is illustrated through detailed descriptions of nine monitoring sites: five in Europe, three in Asia and one in the USA. Most of these monitored catchments cover less than -10 km2 and are topographically rugged with Melton Indices greater than 0.5. Hourly rainfall intensities between 5 and 15 mm/h are sufficient to trigger debris flows at many of the sites, and observed debris-flow volumes range from a few hundred up to almost one million cubic meters. The sensors found in these monitoring systems can be separated into two classes: a class measuring the initiation mechanisms, and another class measuring the flow dynamics. The first class principally includes rain gauges, but also contains of soil moisture and pore-water pressure sensors. The second class involves a large variety of sensors focusing on flow stage or ground vibrations and commonly includes video cameras to validate and aid in the data interpretation. Given the sporadic nature of debris flows, an essential characteristic of the monitoring systems is the differentiation between a continuous mode that samples at low frequency (“non-event mode”) and another mode that records the measurements at high frequency (“event mode”). The event detection algorithm, used to switch into the “event mode” depends on a threshold that is typically based on rainfall or ground vibration. Identifying the correct definition of these thresholds is a fundamental task not only for monitoring purposes, but also for the implementation of warning and alarm systems. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract        = {Landslides and debris flows associated with forest harvesting can cause much destruction and the influence of the timing of harvesting on these mass wasting processes therefore needs to be assessed in order to protect aquatic ecosystems and develop improved strategies for disaster prevention. We examined the effects of forest harvesting on the frequency of landslides and debris flows in the Sanko catchment (central Japan) using nine aerial photo periods covering 1964 to 2003. These photographs showed a mosaic of different forest ages attributable to the rotational management in this area since 1912. Geology and slope gradient are rather uniformly distributed in the Sanko catchment, facilitating assessment of forest harvesting effects on mass wasting without complication of other factors. Trends of new landslides and debris flows correspond to changes in slope stability explained by root strength decay and recovery; the direct impact of clearcutting on landslide occurrence was greatest in forest stands that were clearcut 1 to 10 yr earlier with progressively lesser impacts continuing up to 25 yr after harvesting. Sediment supply rate from landslides in forests clearcut 1 to 10 yr earlier was about 10-fold higher than in control sites. Total landslide volume in forest stands clearcut 0 to 25 yr earlier was 5{\textperiodcentered}8 x 103 m3 km-2 compared with 1{\textperiodcentered}3 x 103 m3 km-2 in clearcuts >25 yr, indicating a fourfold increase compared with control sites during the period when harvesting affected slope stability. Because landslide scars continue to produce sediment after initial failure, sediment supply from landslides continues for 45 yr in the Sanko catchment. To estimate the effect of forest harvesting and subsequent regeneration on the occurrence of mass wasting in other regions, changes in root strength caused by decay and recovery of roots should be investigated for various species and environmental conditions.

  abstract        = {Recent advances in theory and experimentation motivate a thorough reassessment of the physics of debris flows. Analyses of flows of dry, granular solids and solid-fluid mixtures provide a foundation for a comprehensive debris flow theory, and experiments provide data that reveal the strengths and limitations of theoretical models. Both debris flow materials and dry granular materials can sustain shear stresses while remaining static; both can deform in a slow, tranquil mode characterized by enduring, frictional grain contacts; and both can flow in a more rapid, agitated mode characterized by brief, inelastic grain collisions. In debris flows, however, pore fluid that is highly viscous and nearly incompressible, composed of water with suspended silt and clay, can strongly mediate intergranular friction and collisions. Grain friction, grain collisions, and viscous fluid flow may transfer significant momentum simultaneously. Both the vibrational kinetic energy of solid grains (measured by a quantity termed the granular temperature) and the pressure of the intervening pore fluid facilitate motion of grains past one another, thereby enhancing debris flow mobility. Granular temperature arises from conversion of flow translational energy to grain vibrational energy, a process that depends on shear rates, grain properties, boundary conditions, and the ambient fluid viscosity and pressure. Pore fluid pressures that exceed static equilibrium pressures result from local or global debris contraction. Like larger, natural debris flows, experimental debris flows of ∼10 m3 of poorly sorted, water-saturated sediment invariably move as an unsteady surge or series of surges. Measurements at the base of experimental flows show that coarse-grained surge fronts have little or no pore fluid pressure. In contrast, finer-grained, thoroughly saturated debris behind surge fronts is nearly liquefied by high pore pressure, which persists owing to the great compressibility and moderate permeability of the debris. Realistic models of debris flows therefore require equations that simulate inertial motion of surges in which high-resistance fronts dominated by solid forces impede the motion of low-resistance tails more strongly influenced by fluid forces. Furthermore, because debris flows characteristically originate as nearly rigid sediment masses, transform at least partly to liquefied flows, and then transform again to nearly rigid deposits, acceptable models must simulate an evolution of material behavior without invoking preternatural changes in material properties. A simple model that satisfies most of these criteria uses depth-averaged equations of motion patterned after those of the Savage-Hutter theory for gravity-driven flow of dry granular masses but generalized to include the effects of viscous pore fluid with varying pressure. These equations can describe a spectrum of debris flow behaviors intermediate between those of wet rock avalanches and sediment-laden water floods. With appropriate pore pressure distributions the equations yield numerical solutions that successfully predict unsteady, nonuniform motion of experimental debris flows.},

@article{Iverson2011,
  abstract        = {Debris flows typically occur when intense rainfall or snowmelt triggers landslides or extensive erosion on steep, debris-mantled slopes. The flows can then grow dramatically in size and speed as they entrain material from their beds and banks, but the mechanism of this growth is unclear. Indeed, momentum conservation implies that entrainment of static material should retard the motion of the flows if friction remains unchanged. Here we use data from large-scale experiments to assess the entrainment of bed material by debris flows. We find that entrainment is accompanied by increased flow momentum and speed only if large positive pore pressures develop in wet bed sediments as the sediments are overridden by debris flows. The increased pore pressure facilitates progressive scour of the bed, reduces basal friction and instigates positive feedback that causes flow speed, mass and momentum to increase. If dryer bed sediment is entrained, however, the feedback becomes negative and flow momentum declines. We infer that analogous feedbacks could operate in other types of gravity-driven mass flow that interact with erodible beds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {Carbopol gel systems have been studied using steady, oscillatory rheology, and cryoscanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) analysis in order to elucidate the nature of the different microstructures of the gel in relation to polymer concentration as well as triethanolamine (TEA) content. The effect of changing the concentration of Carbopol (0.1-4 wt%) for 0, 1, and 10 wt% TEA has been investigated. Cryo-SEM revealed that honeycomb structures were observed in the gel system depending on the amount of TEA and Carbopol while the irregular fibrous three dimensional gel network systems were seen at the lower level of polymer content even in the high concentration of TEA. In addition to that, as the amount of polymer was increased, strings of fibrous network became thicker and of honeycomb-like structure. Shape of storage modulus-shear stress curve in the dynamical rheometric study was significantly changed as a result of variation in the microstructures while frequency sweep curve and yield values obtained from the model fitting in the steady rheological measurements couldn't reflect the structural difference of Carbopol gels. Two distinct relaxation phenomena were appeared with increase in polymer concentration as well as TEA concentration. Temperature dependence of the stress sweep experiment was measured and shown that the effect of temperature (1-80 °C) on the shape of the curve was the similar trend with that of TEA and polymer concentrations, although the temperature dependency on the increment was much weaker than TEA concentration.},

  abstract        = {Slit dams are widely used for managing multiphase geophysical flows with diverse objectives. However, quantitatively linking dam configurations and flow properties to design indices remains particularly challenging for multiphase flows. This study performs systematic hydro-mechanical simulations of slit dams in arresting debris flows, debris avalanches, and rock avalanches, using a coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM). Our high-fidelity simulations reasonably capture essential physics observed in experiments. Furthermore, unified design diagrams are compiled from multiple perspectives to quantitatively link flow properties (fluid contents and Fr conditions) and spillway width to crucial design indices, including overspilling dynamics, downstream momentum reduction ratio $\zeta$, and retention efficiency. The results reveal that: i) Fr exhibits nonlinear correlations with these design indices that vary significantly during the impact regime transitions from pileup to runup, due to the resulting changes in the size and shape jammed and mobilized domains; ii) Both $\zeta$ and retention efficiency negatively correlate with fluid content, Fr, and spillway width, with different priorities; and iii) Fluid contents and Fr jointly govern overspilling dynamics, while increasing spillway width can effectively reduce retention efficiency by changing trap patterns, including clogging, blockage and self-cleaning traps. This study and its findings contribute deep insights into multiphase flow-dam interactions and offer a unique physics-based dataset to facilitate the demand-oriented design of slit dams for controlling various anticipated flows.},

  abstract        = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of a new method for quantifying fractional flow reserve (FFR) with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applied to coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD). Background: Measurement of FFR during invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for identifying coronary artery lesions that cause ischemia and improves clinical decision-making for revascularization. Computation of FFR from CCTA data (FFRCT) provides a noninvasive method for identifying ischemia-causing stenosis; however, the diagnostic performance of this new method is unknown. Methods: Computation of FFR from CCTA data was performed on 159 vessels in 103 patients undergoing CCTA, invasive coronary angiography, and FFR. Independent core laboratories determined FFR CT and CAD stenosis severity by CCTA. Ischemia was defined by an FFRCT and FFR ≤0.80, and anatomically obstructive CAD was defined as a CCTA with stenosis <50%. Diagnostic performance of FFRCT and CCTA stenosis was assessed with invasive FFR as the reference standard. Results: Fifty-six percent of patients had <1 vessel with FFR ≤0.80. On a per-vessel basis, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 84.3%, 87.9%, 82.2%, 73.9%, 92.2%, respectively, for FFRCT and were 58.5%, 91.4%, 39.6%, 46.5%, 88.9%, respectively, for CCTA stenosis. The area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve was 0.90 for FFRCT and 0.75 for CCTA (p = 0.001). The FFRCT and FFR were well correlated (r = 0.717, p < 0.001) with a slight underestimation by FFRCT (0.022 ± 0.116, p = 0.016). Conclusions: Noninvasive FFR derived from CCTA is a novel method with high diagnostic performance for the detection and exclusion of coronary lesions that cause ischemia.

  abstract        = {The problem of steady subcritical free surface flow past a submerged inclined step is considered. The asymptotic limit of small Froude number is treated, with particular emphasis on the effect that changing the angle of the step face has on the surface waves. As demonstrated by Chapman & Vanden-Broeck, (2006) Exponential asymptotics and gravity waves. J. Fluid Mech. 567, 299a-326, the divergence of a power series expansion in powers of the square of the Froude number is caused by singularities in the analytic continuation of the free surface; for an inclined step, these singularities may correspond to either the corners or stagnation points of the step, or both, depending on the angle of inclination. Stokes lines emanate from these singularities, and exponentially small waves are switched on at the point the Stokes lines intersect with the free surface. Our results suggest that for a certain range of step angles, two wavetrains are switched on, but the exponentially subdominant one is switched on first, leading to an intermediate wavetrain not previously noted. We extend these ideas to the problem of flow over a submerged bump or trench, again with inclined sides. This time there may be two, three or four active Stokes lines, depending on the inclination angles. We demonstrate how to construct a base topography such that wave contributions from separate Stokes lines are of equal magnitude but opposite phase, thus cancelling out. Our asymptotic results are complemented by numerical solutions to the fully nonlinear equations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Objectives of this work are to experimentally analyse the dynamic impact of dry avalanches on structures and to examine the possibility of extending the results to debris flows; to identify structure efficiency in terms of extension and shape of the deposition area; to numerically validate the adequacy of shallow-water equations in reproducing the impact process and the maximum force on the obstacle; finally to propose an analytical expressior for estimating the design force. Experiments were carried out on two dry sandy mixtures flowing down a steep chute and impacting on obstacles of different shape that reproduce check-dams, filter-dams, "houses" and flow-breakers. Effects of mixture composition, obstacle shape and orientation-with respect to mean flow direction - on force values and deposit extension were examined, showing that only check-dams can significantly reduce the kinetic energy and retain the flowing material, Numerical simulations were performed with a 1D code, based on shallow-water equations and the weighted average flux method, to represent forces on an infinite high obstacle (i.e., a wall) in time. Promising results allowed the use of a simple expression directly derived from momentum balance to compute the force exerted by the flow on the structure for given upstream flow depth and velocity. Limitations of the experiments in reproducing impact on defence works in real events are highlighted and suggestions for improving structural design are drawn. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research.},

abstract = {We present measurements of hillslope debris flow impact pressures on small obstacles. Two impact sensors have been installed in a real-scale experimental site where 50 m 3 of water-saturated soil material are released from rest. Impact velocities vary between 2 and 13 m/s; flow heights between 0. 3 and 1. 0 m. The maximum impact pressures measured over 15 events represent between 2 and 50 times the equivalent static pressures. The measurements reveal that quadratic velocity-dependent formulas can be used to estimate impact pressures. Impact coefficients C are constant from front to tail and range between 0. 4 < C < 0. 8 according to the individual events. The pressure fluctuations to depend on the sensor size and are between 20% and 60% of the mean pressure values. Our results suggest that hazard guidelines for hillslope debris flows should be based on quadratic velocity-dependent formulas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

For this reason, 16 debris-flow experiments, on a small-scale modelling approach, were performed. Impact forces were measured with a force plate panel, consisting of 24 aluminium devices, coaxially mounted with resistance strain gauges. Flow velocities, flow heights as well as horizontal impact forces were sampled with a frequency of 2. 4 kHz. Sub datasets of sampled raw force data were defined by applying an average median filter, a low-pass filter routine. Further, estimated peak pressure values as well as empirical coefficients of hydraulic impact models were compared, and the influence of signal processing is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

@article{Song2017,
abstract = {The dynamics of debris flows are fundamentally governed by the interaction between the solid and fluid phases. However, current approaches used to estimate impact load treat debris flow as an equivalent fluid without considering solid-fluid interaction separately from other factors. In this study, a series of centrifuge tests was carried out to investigate the influence of interaction between solid and fluid phases on single-surge debris flow impact on a rigid barrier. The effect of solid-fluid interaction was studied by varying the solid fraction of the flows. A model rigid barrier was instrumented to capture induced bending moment and impact pressure. Test results demonstrate that the transition from a pile-up mechanism to a run-up mechanism is governed by the solid fraction and thus the grain contact stresses. The rigid barrier design for the impact with a pile-up mechanism is mainly dominated by the static load. Contrary to the hydrodynamic approach, which assumes that the frontal impact is the most critical, the frontal impact of a run-up mechanism contributes less than 25% of the total force impulse. The consideration of static loading leads to the development of a new impact model with a triangular distribution of the impact pressure. {\textcopyright} 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

@article{DeHaas2015,
abstract = {Predicting debris flow runout is of major importance for hazard mitigation. Apart from topography and volume, runout distance and area depends on debris flow composition and rheology, but how is poorly understood. We experimentally investigated effects of composition on debris flow runout, depositional mechanisms, and deposit geometry. The small-scale experimental debris flows were largely similar to natural debris flows in terms of flow behavior, deposit morphology, grain size sorting, channel width-depth ratio, and runout. Deposit geometry (lobe thickness and width) in our experimental debris flows is largely determined by composition, while the effects of initial conditions of topography (i.e., outflow plain slope and channel slope and width) and volume are negligible. We find a clear optimum in the relations of runout with coarse-material fraction and clay fraction. Increasing coarse-material concentration leads to larger runout. However, excess coarse material results in a large accumulation of coarse debris at the flow front and enhances diffusivity, increasing frontal friction and decreasing runout. Increasing clay content initially enhances runout, but too much clay leads to very viscous flows, reducing runout. Runout increases with channel slope and width, outflow plain slope, debris flow volume, and water fraction. These results imply that debris flow runout depends at least as much on composition as on topography. This study improves understanding of the effects of debris flow composition on runout and may aid future debris flow hazard assessments.},

@article{Malet2004,
  abstract        = {Clayey slow-moving landslides are characterized by their capability to suddenly change behaviour and release debris-flows. Due to their sediment volume and their high mobility, they are far more dangerous than those resulting from continuous erosive processes and associated potential high hazard magnitude on alluvial fans. A case of transformation from earthflow to debris flow is presented. An approach combining geomorphology, geotechnics, rheology and numerical analysis is adopted. Results show a very good agreement between the yield stress values measured by laboratory tests, in the field according to the morphology of the levees, and by back-analyses using the debris-flow modelling code, Bing. The runout distances and the deposit thickness in the depositional area are also well reproduced. This allows proposing debris-flow risk scenarios. Results show that clayey earthflows can transform under 5-years return period rainfall conditions into 1 km runout debris-flows of volumes ranging between 2,000 to 5,000 m 3 .},

The governing differential equations (continuity and momentum) have been solved over a wide range of Bingham number as 1≤Bn≤10 5. Similar to the case of a circular cylinder, three zones of unyielded regions are seen to be present in the vicinity of the submerged cylinder, namely, caps attached to the top and bottom surfaces of the square cylinder, two sectors situated on the lateral sides undergoing rigid-body like motion and the usual far away unyielded regions. The influence of the Bingham number on their size and on the stress (normal and shear components) field in the vicinity of the cylinder is discussed in detail. In addition, the corresponding rate of strain, pressure and stress contours are also presented to facilitate the visualization of the structure of the flow field for scores of values of Bingham number. Also, the present numerical drag results have been correlated with the Bingham number via a simple expression thereby enabling their interpolation for the intermediate values of Bingham numbers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

These total numbers of landslides and victims are an order of magnitude greater than other data sets have indicated, but analysis of the data suggests that it may still slightly underestimate the true human costs. The majority of human losses occur in Asia, especially along the Himalayan Arc and in China.

Appropriate techniques have been used to characterize the physical properties of the bulk gel and inter-phase slip at the wall. Previously published data are analysed and used wherever possible. Terminology and measurement difficulties are also addressed. The structure of Carbopol dispersions can be described in terms of polydisperse glasses made of individual swollen hydrophylic elastic sponges. They display elastoplasticity, and significant dissipation both below and above their yield stress. Hardly any creep was observed over 10 months of experiments. Scaling laws are proposed for Carbopol mechanical properties as a function of concentration. Carbopol behaviour varies with the value of concentration, and in particular when comparing percolation concentration with close-packing concentration.

  abstract        = {Classifications of flowing sediment-water mixtures have, in the past, been based primarily on relative, qualitative differences in the style and rate of movement as well as on morphology and sedimentology of deposits. A more quantitative and physically relevant classification is presented here, based on thresholds in rh{\'{e}}ologie behavior. The classification is constructed on a two-dimensional matrix in which flows are located according to deformation rate (mean velocity) and sediment concentration, with composition of the mixture constant. Three major rh{\'{e}}ologie boundaries are crossed as sediment concentration increases from 0 (clear water) to 100 percent (dry sediment): (1) the acquisition of a yield strength-the transition from liquid "normal streamflow" to plastic "hyperconcentrated streamflow"; (2) an abrupt increase in yield strength coinciding with the onset of liquefaction behavior-the transition to "slurry flow"; and (3) the loss of the ability to liquefy-the transition of "granular flow." These three rh{\'{e}}ologie boundaries shift according to particle-size distribution and composition of the mixture. Processes controlling flow behavior depend on deformation rate (velocity). Rateindependent frictional and viscous forces dominate at lower velocities and in finer grained mixtures; rate-dependent inertial forces dominate at higher velocities and in coarser grained mixtures. As velocity increases, grain-support mechanisms change from low-energy varieties (buoyancy, cohesion, structural support) to progressively higher energy mechanisms (turbulence, dispersive stress, fluidization). Existing nomenclatures of geologic flow phenomena can fit within this rh{\'{e}}ologie classification. The morphology and sedimentology of flow deposits commonly can be used to deduce rh{\'{e}}ologie behavior, but caution needs to be exercised in inferring processes from deposits.},

  abstract        = {Bubbles rising steadily in Carbopol often have an inverted teardrop shape with pointed tail, in contrast to steady bubble rise computations using simple yield stress fluid models. The cause of the pointed tail is suspected to be viscoelasticity, but another possibility is that the tail arises during the bubble formation and the shape is retained via some form of fluid memory effect (elastic, thixotropic or yield stress). Here we present results of a study in which we eliminate all possibility of memory effects using a multi-layered experimental design, but still find the pointed tail in steady bubble propagation. Thus, the tail shape can only result from a combination of the rheology and steady fluid deformation around the rising bubble. Further experiments show that the same steady shapes are found for quite different initial bubble shapes. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Singh2000,
  abstract        = {A code based on the distributed Lagrange multiplier/fictitious domain method (DLM) is used to study the motion of a sphere sedimenting in a viscoelastic liquid near a vertical wall. The viscoelastic liquid is assumed to be shear thinning and modeled by a shear-thinning Oldroyd-B model. Our simulations show that when the Deborah number based on the sphere velocity is O(1) and its initial position is sufficiently close to the wall, it moves towards the wall. This tendency of a sedimenting sphere to move closer to the vertical wall is enhanced by shear thinning, and also by an increase in the Deborah number. In a Newtonian liquid, on the other hand, the sphere moves away from the vertical wall and attains a steady position between the channel center and the wall. The sense of rotation of a sedimenting sphere when it is close to the vertical wall, for both Newtonian and viscoelastic liquids, is anomalous, i.e. the sphere rotates as if rolling up the wall. However, when the sphere is away from the wall the direction of rotation reverses. These results are in agreement with the experimental data reported in [D.D. Joseph et al., J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 54 (1994) 45-86; Y.J. Liu et al., J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 50 (1993) 305-329; D.D. Joseph et al., Theoretical and Applied Rheology, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1992, pp. 60-65; D.L.E. Becker et al., J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 63 (1996) 45-86]. In two dimensions, on the other hand, simulations show that a sedimenting cylinder moves away from the wall in both Newtonian and viscoelastic liquids. These numerical results prove that the attraction between a wall and a particle sedimenting in a viscoelastic liquid is a three-dimensional effect, i.e. exists for a sphere but not for a cylinder, and it is enhanced by shear thinning.},

@article{Staley2013,
  abstract        = {Rainfall intensity-duration (ID) thresholds are commonly used to predict the temporal occurrence of debris flows and shallow landslides. Typically, thresholds are subjectively defined as the upper limit of peak rainstorm intensities that do not produce debris flows and landslides, or as the lower limit of peak rainstorm intensities that initiate debris flows and landslides. In addition, peak rainstorm intensities are often used to define thresholds, as data regarding the precise timing of debris flows and associated rainfall intensities are usually not available, and rainfall characteristics are often estimated from distant gauging locations. Here, we attempt to improve the performance of existing threshold-based predictions of post-fire debris-flow occurrence by utilizing data on the precise timing of debris flows relative to rainfall intensity, and develop an objective method to define the threshold intensities. We objectively defined the thresholds by maximizing the number of correct predictions of debris flow occurrence while minimizing the rate of both Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors. We identified that (1) there were statistically significant differences between peak storm and triggering intensities, (2) the objectively defined threshold model presents a better balance between predictive success, false alarms and failed alarms than previous subjectively defined thresholds, (3) thresholds based on measurements of rainfall intensity over shorter duration (≤60 min) are better predictors of post-fire debris-flow initiation than longer duration thresholds, and (4) the objectively defined thresholds were exceeded prior to the recorded time of debris flow at frequencies similar to or better than subjective thresholds. Our findings highlight the need to better constrain the timing and processes of initiation of landslides and debris flows for future threshold studies. In addition, the methods used to define rainfall thresholds in this study represent a computationally simple means of deriving critical values for other studies of nonlinear phenomena characterized by thresholds. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).},

@article{Toparlar2017,
  abstract        = {Urban microclimate studies are gaining popularity due to rapid urbanization. Many studies documented that urban microclimate can affect building energy performance, human morbidity and mortality and thermal comfort. Historically, urban microclimate studies were conducted with observational methods such as field measurements. In the last decades, with the advances in computational resources, numerical simulation approaches have become increasingly popular. Nowadays, especially simulations with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is frequently used to assess urban microclimate. CFD can resolve the transfer of heat and mass and their interaction with individual obstacles such as buildings. Considering the rapid increase in CFD studies of urban microclimate, this paper provides a review of research reported in journal publications on this topic till the end of 2015. The studies are categorized based on the following characteristics: morphology of the urban area (generic versus real) and methodology (with or without validation study). In addition, the studies are categorized by specifying the considered urban settings/locations, simulation equations and models, target parameters and keywords. This review documents the increasing popularity of the research area over the years. Based on the data obtained concerning the urban location, target parameters and keywords, the historical development of the studies is discussed and future perspectives are provided. According to the results, early CFD microclimate studies were conducted for model development and later studies considered CFD approach as a predictive methodology. Later, with the established simulation setups, research efforts shifted to case studies. Recently, an increasing amount of studies focus on urban scale adaptation measures. The review hints a possible change in this trend as the results from CFD simulations can be linked up with different aspects (e.g. economy) and with different scales (e.g. buildings), and thus, CFD can play an important role in transferring urban climate knowledge into engineering and design practice. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors},

  abstract        = {We provide research findings on the physics of aerosol and droplet dispersion relevant to the hypothesized aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic. We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, along with previous literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets (d⩽20$\mu$m) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes O(100$\mu$m), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the individuals, who have been tested positive on COVID-19, could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give various examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols (d⩽20$\mu$m) over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modelling. The developed model takes into account the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, 'exposure time' to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional 'safety distance' thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s) to O(1min) or even to O(1h) depending on the situation. The Monte-Carlo simulations, along with the theory, provide clear quantitative insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors},

  abstract        = {Shaanxi Province, located in northwest China and spanning multiple hydroclimatic and geological zones, has many areas largely suffering from rainfall-induced landslide and debris flow. The objectives of this study are to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics of the two hazards and identify their major controlling factors in this region based on a region-wide, comprehensive ground-survey-based hazard inventory dataset from 2009 to 2012. We investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of the two hazards and quantified the relationships between the occurrence rates of the two hazards and their influencing factors, including antecedent rainfall amount, rainfall duration, rainfall intensity, terrain slope, land cover type and soil type. The results show that landslide has a higher occurrence rate and more extensive distribution than debris flow in this region, while the two hazards are both concentrated in the south with ample rainfall and steep terrains. Both of the hazards show clear seasonalities: July-September for landslide and July for debris flow. Rainfall characteristics (amount, duration and intensity) and slope are the dominant factors controlling slope stability across this region. Debris flow is more sensitive to these rainfall metrics on the high-value ranges than landslide in this region. Land cover is another influencing factor but soil type does not appear to impose consistent impacts on the occurrence of the two hazards. This study not only provides important inventory data for studying the landslide and debris flow hazards but also adds valuable information for modeling and predicting the two hazards to enhance resilience to these hazards in this region. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2019.},

  abstract        = {Debris flows are a common type of geological hazard. They move down slopes at rapid speeds, causing severe damage to buildings and humans. It is of great significance to study the development and movement characteristics of debris flows. In this study, we developed a numerical method of simulating the movement of debris flows. The phase fraction was used to represent the contents of the debris flow components. The Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou model was used to simulate the movement of the fine particle-water mixture in the debris flow, and the pressure-dependent Coulomb viscoplastic model was used to describe the movement of the gravel-size particles. The interface between the debris flow and the air was obtained using the volume of fluid method. The above models were implanted in OpenFOAM. Finally, indoor experimental data were used to verify the numerical method developed in this study, and the experimental and simulation results were found to be in good agreement. The proposed method was then applied to debris flow prediction in the Aiwa Watershed, Beijing. The homogeneous flow model developed in this study can significantly reduce the number of calculations required and can be used for the three-dimensional simulation of large-scale debris flows.},

@article{Zheng2019,
  abstract        = {Understanding transition and turbulence in the flow of shear-thinning non-Newtonian fluids remains substantially unresolved and additional research is required to develop better computational methods for wall-bounded turbulent flows of these fluids. Previous DNS studies of shear-thinning fluids mainly use purpose-built codes and simple geometries such as pipes and channels. However in practical application, the geometry of mixing vessels, pumps and other process equipment is far more complex, and more flexible computational methods are required. In this paper a general-purpose DNS approach for shear-thinning fluids is undertaken using the OpenFOAM CFD library. DNS of turbulent Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow in a pipe flow are conducted and the accuracy and efficiency of OpenFOAM are assessed against a validated high-order spectral element-Fourier DNS code - Semtex. The results show that OpenFOAM predicts the flow of shear-thinning fluids to be a little more transitional than the predictions from Semtex, with lower radial and azimuthal turbulence intensities and higher axial intensity. Despite this, the first and second order turbulence statistics differ by at most 16%, and usually much less. An assessment of the parallel scaling of OpenFOAM indicates that OpenFOAM scales very well for the CPUs from 8 to 512, but the intranode scalability is poor for less than 8CPUs. The present work shows that OpenFOAM can be used for DNS of shear-thinning fluids in the simple case of pipe flow, and suggests that more complex flows, where flow separation is often important, are likely to be simulated with accuracies that are acceptably good for engineering application.},
